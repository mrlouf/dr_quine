Aside from having a cool name, this small algo project will get you acquainted with auto-replication problems and confront the Kleene recursion theorem.

## Definition
A quine (or selfref) is a computer program that, upon execution, prints its exact own source code.<br>
Translated into English, it would give something along the lines of:
> "Is not a quine" is not a quine.<br>

Or sort of, you get the idea.

## Project
A quine can virtually be written in any programming language, even in shell scripts, although some are more adapted than others for that.<br>
C and the `printf` function is quite a good candidate, and this is one language imposed by the subject.<br>
The other language imposed is Assembly (NASM x86_64 Linux).<br>
In the bonus part, you may choose the language of your choice to rewrite the programs of the mandatory part.<br>
